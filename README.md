# Rifampicin-Metoprolol-DDI
Modeling of published rifampicin-metoprolol-DDI studies for model evaluation

## Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a PK-Sim snapshot containing simulations of all published clinical studies used to evaluate the predictive performance of the rifampicin and metoprolol models regarding rifampicin-metoprolol-DDIs, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. The applied models have been published previously [1,2]. The originally published metoprolol model [2] was adapted to include a CYP3A4-mediated clearance process. 

For further details and documentation please refer to [3].
